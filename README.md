## About The Project

Komac is a manifest creator for WinGet. It stands for **KO**tlin **MA**nifest **C**reator. Komac is currently in rapid development and aims to reach feature parity with other manifest creation tools, such as YamlCreate and WinGetCreate. The goal is to develop on the features that both these tools provide with extra functionality, such as a parameters, which allows for straightforward usage in automation. Komac is by no means stable; the first goal is to be able to create a manifest from scratch.

## What can I use in the meantime?

There are already well-established tools in the community. For manifest creation, use:

- ⭐ [YamlCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/Tools/YamlCreate.ps1)
- [WinGetCreate](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-create)

For automated releases to WinGet, use:
- ⭐ [WinGet Releaser](https://github.com/vedantmgoyal2009/winget-releaser)

> Note: these are my personal recommendations. Ones that are starred are tools I actively use myself.
